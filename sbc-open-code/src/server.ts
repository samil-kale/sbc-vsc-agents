 * opencode is a client/server program: `opencode serve` is the instance that owns the
 * SQLite database, and the TUI is one of its clients (`opencode attach <url>`). We run
 * that server ourselves and point everything at it - the session listing, renames, the
 * event stream, and the terminal's own TUI.
 *
 * Talking to opencode any other way means running a second, unrelated instance that only
 * shares the database file, which is what this extension used to do. Measured costs of
 * that: every `session list` boots an instance (~1.2s, versus ~12ms over HTTP), a read
 * writes to the database, and events never cross the process boundary - a change made in
 * the terminal's TUI was invisible to us.
